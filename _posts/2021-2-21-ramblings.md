title: Meaning of Life

# What are my thoughts?

I see people are always obsessed with the meaning of life. Is life meaningful? Is it meaningless? What is the meaning of life? Philosophers, philistines, preachers, prophets, professors, programmers, poets, potheads, pimps, players, paedophiles, practically everyone has thought about it. I have thought about it too. I have thought about it at the church or temple, kneeling in front of an altar, when deep inside my cynical heart I feel the spark of faith, when a collective voice of the pious dead seems to tell me, “Belief. That’s what it is. Believe in the messy and grand design of the universe, of its creator. Don’t spend too much energy trying to unravel it, although trying does not hurt.” Seems true. Despite all my education and intelligence, I spend hours trying to assemble an Ikea shelf. Hell, I am 24, but still feel the need to sniff the sofa after a particularly nasty fart. When an occasional pile of shit, my shit, fills the toilet and some pieces of strong solid turds float on the surface, my face still glows with pride. I cannot swim, my shit floats better in water than me. I failed my driver’s test four times, cannot seem to do a lot of things that normal people do every day with ease and comfort. So how the hell can a fart-sniffing, shit-liking (my own shit), drowny, incompetent nutcase like me figure out God, his plans, his designs, and his pre-ordained meaning for my life? Perhaps it is beyond me, and I just need to believe. Or perhaps there is a little bit of meaning in all these things: the nauseating smell of your own fart, the pride in plentiful excrement, embarrassing failures, dumb mistakes, and unbelievable incompetence. Just as there is meaning in the true, the good, the beautiful, the pleasant, and the solemn.
