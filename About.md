I am a graduate research assistant for the School of Business, Penn State Harrisburg. I study Information Systems. This is my first attempt at buiding a website, so please put up with this shit.

### This website will house:
- my research projects.
- links to my publications.
- most recent CV.
- and whatever else I come up with.
